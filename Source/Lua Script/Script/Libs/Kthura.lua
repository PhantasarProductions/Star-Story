       This file contains some quick functions for quick access to Kthura
       Maps. This file even contains a few feature to actually edit Kthura 
       maps directly. It goes without saying but this script should therefore
       be handled with care. You've no idea how dangerous a lua script can be
       when not handled properly. (I've heard the statement "It's just a Lua
       script" way too often). :)
       
       Please note, this file is only set up for the way the LAURA II engine
       delivers its Kthura API. I can therefore not guarantee this file will
       work in other engines using Kthura.
       
       Also, be sure to get rid of the data obtained prior to loading a new map.
       If you try to read or write to an object belonging to a map no longer
       in the system's memory LAURA II will crash, and throw no error message 
       (if running LAURA II from a console, only the message "ERROR" may appear
       on the console, and that's all you get).
       
       If you are not sure about what you are doing, then leave this file
       be and use the official documented commands only.
