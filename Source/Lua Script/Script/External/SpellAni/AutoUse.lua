-- @USEDIR Script/Use/Anyway

--[[

     This folder contains some spell animations of spells/skills/abilities/ARMS that I don't expect the player to use often
     which can also require quite some great assets, or may eat a lot of memory by themselves.
     
     After usage the scripts are disposed from the memory.
     
     All scripts will require a function named SPELLANI(ag,ai,tg,ai), though the system will send everything in strings to it only.
     Returned data is ignored.
