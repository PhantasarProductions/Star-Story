#Alright, girls.
#You two have been chosen to do your first real mission.
#I hope you realize that you're officially still students,
#and thus you'll have to stay with me all the time, got that?

*Briggs
:GENERAL
#I read in the reports that you two had the best marks for your theory this year.
#I'd like to congratulate you with that, but the real work is only about to begin. Practice.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#You can consider the next six months as one great exam. All you do will be taken note of. You will contribute to real missions. Don't think nothing can go wrong, as this is all for real. De chance something may happen to you is just as big as when you do the same mission when you have completed the training.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#The more dangerous the missiom, the more points you can earn with them and this mission as danger factor 9, which means that if you succeed in this mission the chance you pass your exam will be very great.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#In the same time this means that if you mess this up, your chances for survival are slim. Do you girls fully realize that?


@SCEN_E
!Wendicka and Crystal
*
:GENERAL
#Yes, sir!


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Very well,
#I also read that you have been best friends since you were little kids.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Let me state immediately that I am not happy you are in the same patrol for exactly that reason.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#You know the rules of M.E.T.E.O.R.
#While M.E.T.E.O.R. always applauds helping a fallen comrade, you always must have a good overview on the situation and you must always have your priorities clear.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#This can mean that you must sometimes place other matters above the life of your comrade.
#Despite your close friendship you may never forget that!
#Am I making myself clear?


@SCEN_E
!Wendicka & Crystal
*Wendicka & Crystal
:GENERAL
#Yes, sir!


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#My name is Sean Briggs.
#That's Leutenant Briggs for you.
#I've been assigned to lead this patrol.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#So that makes the three of us. Due to that we can easier get into the main building, but it also makes us more vulnerable. If anything happens to any of us, our chances will be small.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Our task is simple. The others already are down on the surface of the planet of Palaqor, fighting the Astrilopups and the Rachans. That fight is not easy because the Astrilopups placed combatdroids all over the battlefield.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#M.E.T.E.O.R wants to drive away the Rachans and the Astrilopups at any cost. Palaqor is one of the planets within the IF that's closest to Rachon and losing Palaqot will therefore make it quite difficult to deal with Rachon.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Our task is easy to explain. The computer brain controlling the droids is in the highest tower of the Yaqirpa.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#How the enemy could get that in, is still a mystery to us, but that is something for later investigation.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#We will beam down into the Yaqirpa, while the Rachans are being distracted. We have to reach the computer brein and to destroy it. Know that this brain will be heavily guarded, and due to that you'll both be armed with a Photon gun.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#You'll also both receive a detonator.
#Please realize this is a very powerful explosive.


@SCEN_E
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#That will be all, ladies.
#Please stand on the transporter with me, so we can beam down into action.

@YAQIRPA_WELCOME

*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Right girls, this is the Yaqirpa.
#As you girls should know, this is within the religion on Palaqor the holiest place of the planet.


@YAQIRPA_WELCOME
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#It goes without saying that you should perform this operation in respect of the holy status of this place, even though it has been profaned by the enemy pretty bad.
#You do know how much the IF tries to respect the local cultures and religions of its member planets.


@YAQIRPA_WELCOME
!Briggs
*Briggs
:GENERAL
#Very well, let's begin.
#The tower is on the north-side of the building.
#Let's go!
