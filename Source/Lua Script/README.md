# Lua source

This folder contains the source codes of all Lua scripts for you to view or to analyze in order to find out if a certain bug is caused the way you think it is caused.

Please do not modify any files within the repository itself. All files in this repository are merely copies for my work folder, and this copy is automatically maintained, cut short. Any modification you put in here will automatically disappear on the next update and nobody will ever find your change.

The best way to go is to tell me about some proper modifications in the issue tracker in stead so I can apply those in the actual version.
