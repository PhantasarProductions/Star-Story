# Credits for Star Story


Star Story is a game written and produced by Jeroen Broks. He did the story line, the LAURA II engine, and nearly all of the scripts. A lot of graphics were also done by him though.


The game however would never be possible without additional assets from authors he did either set up a permissive license or extended explicit permission for the usage of several assets into the game. In order to a) keep this repository clean and b) for copyright reasons I cannot share everything in this repository.

However since "honor to whom honor is due" is my motto when it comes to whatever I create, I hereby wanted to list and thank them all! This list is updated live as assets and stuff are added or removed. 

If you see your name below and you think I'm using your stuff against your license conditions, please write an issue in the issue tracker on it, and I can tell you which asset it is and which license conditions were known to me. You should be able to offer me proof, as anybody can claim to be a copyright holder when in fact they are not.

One final note. Since JCR6 uses an aliasing system some contributions are counted twice (or even more times) due to them being aliased. The system updating this list is (unfortunately) not able to tell a true contributions apart from aliases.
