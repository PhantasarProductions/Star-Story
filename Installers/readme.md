# Installers

Here you have a look in the installer scripts.
Please note, they are set up according to how everything is sorted on MY computer, so if they seem a bit illogical to you, you now know why.
I also need to note that I run Inno Setup 5 through WINE on a Mac. The strange pathname setup in calling from the Z: drive is the result of that (as WINE "mounts" the original Mac file system (which is based on unix) as drive Z:)
