# WHAT THE F**** IS WRONG WITH ZIGGO!

Another temp worklog, as long as Ziggo is down.


- FIXED: Infinite loop in "FallDown" effect is fixed
- FIXED: Speed issue in "Falldown" effect is fixed
- FIXED: Foe reset ignore bug fixed (won't affect older savegames untill new dungeon is loaded, once that's done, the reset will work)
- FIXED: Several Foe/Player detection errors (leading to crashes) fixed.
- ISSUE: Put on an 'ignore internet' feature for loadgame.
