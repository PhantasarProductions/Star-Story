# Star-Story-Tracker

This tracker will be used to track down bugs or undesirable behavior in the "Star Story" game. 
At this moment, the game is not yet open for testing, I only opened this tracker already to test things out and to make things ready 
once the testing can truly begin.

This game will be set up to work in Windows and Mac. Unfortunately, I cannot go for a Linux version. Linux is already a crappy OS, and Linux + BlitzMax = HELL! Once the source is released you might try to compile this yourself in Linux, I won't stop you, but I'm not going to pain myself with it any more.

You can follow the some progress on:
- SourceForge: http://starstory.sourceforge.net
- or GameJolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/star-story/58632

A live worklog is kept at: http://starstory.sourceforge.net/uTBBS/index.php?C=QuickWorkLog&A=Show&Board=1

When some open testing can begin will be announced on either site.
