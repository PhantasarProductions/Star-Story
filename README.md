You can also use the issue tracker to report bugs, or request/suggest features.

The source code, some documentation,
The alpha build is no longer available here. It can be obtained by request.
Assets are not part of this repository in order not to violate copyright of third party owners.

This game will be set up to work in Windows and Mac. Unfortunately, I cannot go for a Linux version. This is due to some technical difficulties Linux offers. Since you can find the source in this repository you might try to compile this yourself in Linux, I won't stop you, but I'm not going to pain myself with it any more.

You can follow the some progress on:
- SourceForge: http://starstory.sourceforge.net
- or GameJolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/star-story/58632

A live worklog is kept at: http://starstory.sourceforge.net/uTBBS/index.php?C=QuickWorkLog&A=Show&Board=1

A small "Work in progress" video can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4B7y37vcdM&feature=youtu.be

When some open testing can begin will be announced on either site.






P.S. This game is NOT compatible with Brucey's BlitzMax NG, nor do I plan to make it compatible with it.
