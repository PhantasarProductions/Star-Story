# Star-Story

This tracker can be used to look into the source code of Star Story. You can see the source of the Engine, the launcher and the scripts themselves.

You can also use the issue tracker to report bugs, or request/suggest features.

The source code, some documentation, and the alpha builds can be found here (I decided to go for full builds in this repository because BlitzMax is not a very common compiler (and also one for which you must pay) and I cannot assume everybody knows how to use JCR6 properly, plus that the file does contain third party assets I do not want to put in this repository in "raw" form out of respect for the copyrights of the original creators.

This game will be set up to work in Windows and Mac. Unfortunately, I cannot go for a Linux version. Linux is already a crappy OS, and Linux + BlitzMax = HELL! Once the source is released you might try to compile this yourself in Linux, I won't stop you, but I'm not going to pain myself with it any more.

You can follow the some progress on:
- SourceForge: http://starstory.sourceforge.net
- or GameJolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/star-story/58632

A live worklog is kept at: http://starstory.sourceforge.net/uTBBS/index.php?C=QuickWorkLog&A=Show&Board=1

A small "Work in progress" video can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4B7y37vcdM&feature=youtu.be

When some open testing can begin will be announced on either site.
