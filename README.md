# Star-Story-Tracker

This tracker will be used to track down bugs or undesirable behavior in the "Star Story" game. 
At this moment, the game is not yet open for testing, I only opened this tracker already to test things out and to make things ready 
once the testing can truly begin.

This game will be set up to work in Windows and Mac.
The possibility to make it run in Linux as well is investigated, however not yet promised.

You can follow the some progress on
SourceForge: starstory.sourceforge.net
or GameJolt: http://gamejolt.com/games/star-story/58632

When some open testing can begin will be announced on either site.
