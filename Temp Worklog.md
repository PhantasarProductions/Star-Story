# Temporary worklog

I need to put this in my REAL worklog as soon as my internet works.
This will appear in the rep automatically as soon as the internet works again and then I must delete this :)

- FIXED: Enemy skill ignoring is fixed
- Enemies will chase you now if you get too close, and they are nearly impossible to dodge once they do
- Radius of enemies has been reduced before they chase you
- FAILURE: My ISP Ziggo acted up on me, and that was very frustrating
