NOTE: The alpha version is not yet available for download. The text below is therefore not entirely valid. You can already see these files because I am preparing the game for alpha testing.

# Alpha Build

In this part of the repository the alpha versions for both Mac and Windows will be kept up-to-date on a regular basis. Please note that the game was created on a Mac and thefore the Mac Executable may predate the Windows executables. The assests and scripts are always the same in both versions. A few bugs in the Windows version may therefore come to life due to a few version conflicts, though I'll try to keep the Windows executables up-to-date.


In order to download, update and play the alpha versions you first need the command line version of git and you need version 1.7.0 or higher at least as a feature was used that does not work on any earlier versions. 
If you don't have git, make sure you obtain it :)


### How to do it?
Windows users should download the AlphaStar.bat file in this directory and running this batch file will automatically install Star Story and run it, or in case you already have it automatically update it to the latest version and then run it.
Mac users should download the AlphaStar.sh file in this directory and basically it does everything the AlphaStar.bat file does, but then on Mac. 

Don't worry about compiling and stuff. This has already been done for before you could even get downloading. ;)


### A short tutorial for people unfamiliar with DOS/Unix prompts
If you know how that stuff works, skip this part, but if you don't know then follow this.

###### Windows
Download and save the AlphaStar.bat file to C:\Users\\_username_\AlphaStar
Open the prompt and type the next commands
- cd C:\Users\\_username_\AlphaStar
- AlphaStar

That should do it for you. Of course, substitute _username_ with your system username :)

###### Mac
Download and save the AlphaStar.sh file to /Users/_username_/AlphaStar
Open the terminal, you can find it in your applications folder in the subfolder "utilities"
In the console type the next commands
- cd ~/AlphaStar
- ./AlphaStar.sh


Well, that should do it. Any questions?
