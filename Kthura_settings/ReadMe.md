# Kthura settings files

These are the "Settings" files I have used to configure Kthura for "Star Story"
To use these files just copy the files (with the full directory structure I gave up here) into the same folder as the Kthura Map Editor executable file (Mac users should NOT put it inside the bundle. I mean the folder in which the bundle is located).
You may need to modify these files as they are (or course) configered the way I needed them for my directory settings.

Also the easiest way to create a project with Kthura yourself if by cannibalizing an existing project.

I do need to note one thing. The syntax in the Project file has been deprecated and will soon be replaced by a new syntax. Kthura has only not yet properly been converted to this new setting. The script is just a Lua script so that should be alright.


Full documentation in how to set up or to use Kthura is planned later, and will probably not happen while the "Star Story" project is still running.
